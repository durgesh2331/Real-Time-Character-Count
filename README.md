# Real-time Character Counter

A simple and responsive web-based application that displays a real-time character counter as the user types. It shows both the total number of characters entered and the remaining characters allowed based on a fixed limit.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Live character count updates as you type
- ✅ Displays remaining characters from a maximum of 49
- ✅ Simple and responsive card-style UI
- ✅ Built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## 📂 Project Structure



## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## 📄 How It Works

1. The input field allows the user to type text.
2. As text is entered:
   - The **"Total Character"** count updates.
   - The **"Remaining"** count decreases.
3. Character limit is set to **49** characters.

> ⚠️ Note: The counter stops updating after reaching 49 characters but does not restrict the user from typing further.

## 📸 UI Preview

- A header bar
- A centered card box
- Label: *"Real-time Character Counter"*
- Input box

## 📥 How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Make sure all files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) are in the same directory.
3. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.

## 🔧 Future Improvements

- Add character limit enforcement (prevent input beyond 49).
- Show a warning or change input border color when limit is exceeded.
- Add support for multi-line textarea input.
